# Icedog96
A simple web browser for Windows 96 (windows96.net)

If you don't know what Windows 96 is, it's a JS based parody of Windows (Much like Windows 93)

The thing about Windows 96 is it's alot less well documented, and so this app uses absolutely no Windows 96-specific functions, so the exit button doesn't work
I will eventually port this to Windows 93 if anyone asks about it

This is also probably the first mention of Windows 96 on github in a repo

To use it, download Icedog96.html and Icedog96.link, navigate to C:/user/desktop, then click tools, then upload, then select the .link file you download, then navigate back to C:/ then go to local, then click tools, then upload, then select the html file you download
