# Icedog96
A simple web browser for Windows 96 (windows96.net)

If you don't know what Windows 96 is, it's a JS based parody of Windows (Much like Windows 93)

The thing about Windows 96 is it's alot less well documented, and so this app uses absolutely no Windows 96-specific functions, so the exit button doesn't work
I will eventually port this to Windows 93 if anyone asks about it

This is also probably the first mention of Windows 96 on github in a repo

To use it, download files from the Windows 96 folder, navigate to C:/user/desktop, then click tools, then upload, then select the .link file you download, then navigate back to C:/ then go to local, then click tools, then upload, then select the html file you download

For the Windows 93 Edition, Just download the file and drag it onto the windows 93 desktop
